title: "First day at Robotics Research Center (RRC)"
---

This was basically Introducotry Class for students Joining RRC this summers, We we showcased all the Projects currently being undertaken at Robotics Research Center,<br>

Then followed by that we got started with the basics of liner algebra, 
- We were formally introduced by the terms and much more astanderd ways to deal with vecotrs and Matrices, 
- Usually x is used to represent column matrix and x<sup>T</sup> to represent row Matrics.
- Some Basic Operations
	- Vector addition
	- Scalar Multiplication
	- Element wise Operation.
	- Dot Product.
	- Cross Product.

- <b> Norm is a function that takes a vector and returns a non-negetive number. It satisfies the following four Properties:
	- positivity :  norm(x) >= 0
	- Definiteness : norm(x) = 0 if and only if x = 0;
	- Absolutely homogeneous : norm(\alpha x) = norm(\alpha)norm(x)
	- Triangle inequality : norm(x + y) <= norm(x) + norm(y)
</b>

- There are many types of norm :
