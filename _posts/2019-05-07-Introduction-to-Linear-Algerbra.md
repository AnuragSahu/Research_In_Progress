title: "First day at Robotics Research Center (RRC)"
---

This was basically Introducotry Class for students Joining RRC this summers, We we showcased all the Projects currently being undertaken at Robotics Research Center,<br>

Then followed by that we got started with the basics of liner algebra, 
- We were formally introduced by the terms and much more astanderd ways to deal with vecotrs and Matrices, 
- Usually x is used to represent column matrix and x<sup>T</sup> to represent row Matrics.
- Some Basic Operations
	- Vector addition
	- Scalar Multiplication
	- Element wise Operation.
	- Dot Product.
	- Cross Product.

- <b> Norm is a function that takes a vector and returns a non-negetive number. It satisfies the following four Properties:
	- positivity :  norm(x) >= 0
	- Definiteness : norm(x) = 0 if and only if x = 0;
	- Absolutely homogeneous : norm(\alpha x) = norm(\alpha)norm(x)
	- Triangle inequality : norm(x + y) <= norm(x) + norm(y)
</b>

- There are many types of norm :
	- L2 norm or Eucldean norm : norm(x)<sub>2</sub> = sqrt(x<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup> + x<sub>2</sub><sup>2</sup> + x<sub>3</sub><sup>2</sup> .... x<sub>n</sub><sup>2</sup>)
	- L1 or Manhattan norm : norm(x)<sub>1</sub>  sum i = 1 : n norm(x<sub>i</sub>)
	- Infinity norm: norm(x<sub>infinity</sub>) = max<sub>i</sub>norm(x<sub>i</sub>)
	- p-norm : norm(x<sub>p</sub>) = (norm(x<sub>1</sub>)<sup>p</sup> + norm(x<sub>2</sub>)<sup>p</sup> + ... + norm(x<sub>n</sub>)<sup>p</sup>)<sup>1/p</sup>
