title: "First day at Robotics Research Center (RRC)"
---

This was basically Introducotry Class for students Joining RRC this summers, We we showcased all the Projects currently being undertaken at Robotics Research Center,<br>

Then followed by that we got started with the basics of liner algebra, 
- We were formally introduced by the terms and much more astanderd ways to deal with vecotrs and Matrices, 
- Usually x is used to represent column matrix and x<sup>T</sup> to represent row Matrics.
- Some Basic Operations
	- Vector addition
	- Scalar Multiplication
	- Element wise Operation.
	- Dot Product.
	- Cross Product.

- <b> Norm is a function that takes a vector and returns a non-negetive number. It satisfies the following four Properties:
	- positivity : ||x|| >= 0
	- Definiteness : ||x|| = 0 if and only if x = 0;
	- Absolutely homogeneous : || alpha x || = |alpha|||x||
	- Triangle inequality : ||x + y|| <= ||x|| + ||y||
</b>

- There are many types of norm :
	- L2 norm or Eucldean norm : ||x||<sub>2</sub> = sqrt(x<sup>2</sup><sub>1</sub> + x<sup>2</sup><sub>2</sub> + x<sup>2</sup><sub>3</sub> .... x<sup>2</sup><sub>n</sub>)
	- L1 or Manhattan norm : ||x||<sub>1</sub>  sum i = 1 : n |x<sub>i</sub>
	- Infinity norm: ||x||<sub>infinity</sub> = max<sub>i</sub>|x<sub>i</sub>|
	- p-norm : ||x<sub>p</sub> = (|x<sub>1</sub>|<sup>p</sup> + |x<sub>2</sub>|<sup>p</sup> + ... + |x<sub>n</sub>|<sup>p</sup>)<sup>1/p</sup>>
