*This is reffered from the Free Online Book (Michael A. Nielsen, "Neural Networks and Deep Learning")
- It starts off with the problem of understanding the Visual Cortex System, And produces to solve the problem of Optical Character Recogition.
- How a human would recognise the digit "9" it has a loop on the top and a vertical stroke in the bottom right, althouth this is difficult to code this approach, so how would you recogise it.
- Neural networks take a different approcach, It take a large number of handwritten digits ("Popularly termed as training examples").
- The state of the art Neural Networks can have an accuracy upto 99% which is better than humans.
<h2> Perceptrons </h2>
- Perceptrons were developed in 1950s and 1960s by Frank Rosenblatt, inspired by earlier work by Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts.
- So how does a perceptron works? A perceptron takes several binary inputs, x<sub>1</sub>, x<sub>2</sub>,..., and produces a single biary output:
